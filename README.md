## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   A Firebase project.

### 1. Setup Environment Variables

First, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and populate it with your Firebase project credentials. You can find these in your Firebase project console settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill in the values in `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment using [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting), a fully-managed, serverless hosting service for web applications.

### To Deploy Your App:

1.  **Connect to GitHub:** Go to the Firebase App Hosting section of your Firebase console.
2.  **Create a Backend:** Click "Create backend" and follow the prompts to connect your GitHub repository.
3.  **Automatic Deployments:** Once connected, App Hosting will automatically build and deploy your application.
    -   Every `push` to the `main` branch will update your live site.
    -   Every pull request will generate a temporary preview URL.

The `apphosting.yaml` file in the root of the project contains the configuration for the App Hosting build. The existing `.github/workflows` files are for a legacy deployment method and are not used by App Hosting.

## Customization

### Email Templates

To provide a professional user experience, you can customize the emails Firebase sends for actions like password resets.

1.  Go to the **Firebase Console**.
2.  Navigate to **Authentication** > **Templates**.
3.  Select the **Password reset** template.
