# Tassko - SEO Strategy

This document outlines the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy for the Tassko application. The goal is to maximize organic visibility, attract relevant traffic from search engines like Google and Bing, and increase user acquisition.

## 1. Target Audience

- **Primary:** Professionals, students, and freelancers looking for a digital tool to organize daily tasks and improve productivity.
- **Secondary:** Teams and individuals interested in AI-powered productivity tools and modern Kanban methodologies.

## 2. Keyword Strategy

### Primary Keywords
- Kanban board app
- AI task manager
- Daily planner app
- Task management tool
- Online to-do list

### Secondary Keywords
- Productivity app
- AI task organizer
- Next.js Kanban board
- Task prioritization tool
- Daily reset Kanban

### Long-Tail Keywords
- "Best AI app to organize my day"
- "How to use a Kanban board for daily planning"
- "App to manage morning, midday, evening tasks"
- "Free task manager with AI categorization"

## 3. On-Page SEO Implementation

### a. Metadata Optimization
- **Titles:** Every page will have a unique, descriptive, and keyword-rich `<title>` tag (under 60 characters).
- **Meta Descriptions:** Each page will have a compelling meta description (under 160 characters) that acts as a call-to-action in search results.

### b. Structured Data (Schema Markup)
- Implement `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD schema on the homepage to provide search engines with detailed information about the app (name, category, features, pricing). This enhances the appearance of search results (rich snippets).

### c. Content Hierarchy
- Use proper HTML semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, etc.) to structure content logically.
- The most important page content will be wrapped in a `<main>` tag.

## 4. Technical SEO Implementation

### a. Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`)
- A `sitemap.xml` file will be generated to list all indexable pages of the application. This helps search engine crawlers discover and index all relevant content efficiently.

### b. Robots.txt
- A `robots.txt` file will be created in the `public` directory to guide search engine crawlers.
- It will allow full access to the site while pointing crawlers to the `sitemap.xml`.
- Utility pages like login and signup will be marked with `noindex` via meta tags to prevent them from appearing in search results.

### c. Canonical URLs
- The root layout will specify the canonical URL for the application's domain to prevent duplicate content issues.

### d. Performance
- Continue leveraging Next.js features like server components, code splitting, and image optimization (`next/image`) to ensure fast page load times, a critical ranking factor.

## 5. Content Strategy (Future Work)

- **Blog/Guides:** Create content around our target keywords, such as "5 Ways to Boost Your Daily Productivity with a Kanban Board" or "How AI is Changing Task Management."
- **Landing Pages:** Develop dedicated landing pages for specific features (e.g., "The Ultimate AI Task Prioritizer").
