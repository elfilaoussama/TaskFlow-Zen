## 3. On-Page SEO Implementation

### a. Metadata Optimization
- **Titles:** Every page will have a unique, descriptive, and keyword-rich `<title>` tag (under 60 characters).
- **Meta Descriptions:** Each page will have a compelling meta description (under 160 characters) that acts as a call-to-action in search results. Keywords will be front-loaded where possible.

### b. Structured Data (Schema Markup)
- Implement `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD schema on the homepage to provide search engines with detailed information about the app (name, category, features, pricing). This enhances the appearance of search results (rich snippets) and improves discoverability in app-related searches.

### c. Content Hierarchy
- Use proper HTML semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, etc.) to structure content logically.
- The most important page content will be wrapped in a `<main>` tag.
- Emphasize benefits in headings and content, such as "Boost Your Productivity" and "Organize Your Day with AI Prioritization."

## 4. Technical SEO Implementation

### a. Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`)
- A `sitemap.xml` file will be generated to list all indexable pages of the application. This helps search engine crawlers discover and index all relevant content efficiently.

### b. Robots.txt
- A `robots.txt` file will be created in the `public` directory to guide search engine crawlers.
- It will allow full access to the site while pointing crawlers to the `sitemap.xml`.
- Utility pages like login and signup will be marked with `noindex` via meta tags to prevent them from appearing in search results.

### c. Canonical URLs
- The root layout will specify the canonical URL for the application's domain to prevent duplicate content issues.

### d. Performance
- Continue leveraging Next.js features like server components, code splitting, and image optimization (`next/image`) to ensure fast page load times, a critical ranking factor.

## 5. Content & Off-Page Strategy (Future Work)

### a. Content Creation
- **Blog/Guides:** Create content around our target keywords, such as "5 Ways an AI Task Manager Can Boost Your Productivity" or "How to Organize Your Day with a Time-based Kanban Board."
- **Landing Pages:** Develop dedicated landing pages for specific features (e.g., "Tassko: The Ultimate AI Planner").

### b. Localization
- **Localized Descriptions:** Translate core landing pages and metadata into key languages (e.g., Spanish, French) to capture a wider, international audience.

### c. User-Generated Content
- **Encourage Keyword-Rich Reviews:** Prompt satisfied users to leave reviews. In the prompt, subtly suggest they mention features they love, like the "daily Kanban board" or "AI task prioritization," which can naturally boost keyword relevance.

### d. Multimedia
- **Promo Video:** Create a short promotional video embedded on the homepage. The video's title, description, and spoken content (transcribed by search engines) should include primary keywords within the first 30 seconds.
- **Image ALT Text:** All significant images and screenshots on marketing pages should have descriptive ALT text that includes relevant keywords (e.g., "A screenshot of Tassko's drag-and-drop AI Kanban board").
